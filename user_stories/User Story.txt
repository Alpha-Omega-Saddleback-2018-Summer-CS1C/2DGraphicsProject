a) Description: A file can be passed into the program which creates shapes to be drawn. Any error will result in the program notifying the user and exiting.
b) Tasks:
  - Create a parser to define shape parameters
    - Check for syntax errors
    - Notify and abort on error
  - Add shapes to the shape vector
c) Tests:
  - Verify that a shape will be added to the vector
  - Verify that any syntax errors will generate an error and cause the program to exit
d) Assignee:
  - Brett: implement file-to-token converter
